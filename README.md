# Sunnyside agency landing page

## Introduction

This is a [FrontendMentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef) coding challenge, where I was provided with a design and my job was to get it looking as close to that design as possible.

The main focus of this challenge was mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JavaScript included for the mobile navigation toggle.

The visitors of this Landing page are able to:

- view the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.


## Lessons Learned

- In this challenge I was able to use both flex-box and grids for the layout of the pictures.

- I was also able to improve my CSS animation skills, whick you can check by pressing on the hamburger menu if your are viewing the website from a mobile screen.

- The challenge doesn't provide a design for tablets, so it was an extra challenge to come up with my own layout design for users who view this site on tablets.
